Welcome! I'm a lawyer who has been messing around with computers for over 40 years. (My first memory of computers was playing [Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure) on a mainframe when I was in grade school in the 1970s.) I'm using this site to take notes on technology-related topics.
